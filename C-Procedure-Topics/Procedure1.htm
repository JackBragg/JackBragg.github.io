        <h1>Configuring Oculus Home</h1>
        <p>XYZ is designed to connect Steam VR to the Oculus Home Tray enabling fluid transition from platform to platform. After Installing <a href="https://www.oculus.com/rift/setup/?locale=en_US">Oculus Home</a> , we need to enable third party applications by activating the unknown sources property.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Open <b>Oculus Home</b> client</li>
            <li><b>Log in</b> using personal account information</li>
            <li>Using the navigation bar on the left, select <b>settings</b>.</li>
            <li>Move to the <b>General</b> tab located at the top of the page</li>
            <li>At the top of the list is <b>Unknown Sources</b>, click the <b>sliding button</b> to the right on the same line. The slider will turn blue indicating it is active.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>From here we need to ensure that Oculus home is operating on the most up to date software by enabling <b>beta</b> usage. This is a requirement due to the rapid progress PLEXSYS engineers make in rolling out support and capabilities of our XYZ systems.</p>
        <ol style="list-style-type: lower-alpha;">
            <li>From <b>Settings</b>(located in the left hand navigation window) select the <b>Beta</b> tab at the top of the page.</li>
            <li>locate the <b>Public Test Channel</b> option and click on the <b>slider</b> button to the right , on the same line. The slider will turn blue indicating it is active.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Congratulations, Oculus Home is now prepared to connect with our XYZ platform! You are moments away from activating your enhanced training experience. Please continue on to <a href="Procedure2.htm">Steam VR</a> installation and setup.</p>
