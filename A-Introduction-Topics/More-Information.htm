        <h1>More Information</h1>
        <p>Our testing has shown that the experience our participants augmented with our XYZ technology, have more closely resonated with real world situations and increased effectiveness of training. Command Staff have also noted that platform learning curves have been drastically cut down leading to faster adoption.</p>
        <p>XYZ is the frontier of Command, Control, and Communications (C3) systems and enable faster and fluid actions across all scenarios. As a training tool, XYZ facilitates instructor guidance and pacing by enabling "over the shoulder" functionality.</p>
        <p>Virtual Reality has been shown to drastically increase lesson retention and confidence in applying lessons to real world scenarios. It also allows instructors to more accurately assess candidate progress and capability. This facilitates a more curtailed lesson plan for participants without significantly adding to the individual work load of the instructor.</p>
        <p>When compared side by side, participants progress through lessons 35% faster than participants not using XYZ. Combined with increased comprehension and situational confidence, participants showed 48% increase in retention of lessons under high pressure scenarios.</p>
