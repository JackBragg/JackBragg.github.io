        <h1>Getting Started</h1>
        <p>*** Out of Context Note ***</p>
        <p>I used <a href="https://youtu.be/aOlCa7hr62k">this video</a> to simulate listening to someone leading me through the process then translating that into a guide. I am leaving the links blank to ensure that no one tries to download unofficial software.</p>
        <p>also, as of this writing steam vr already recognizes the Oculus quest with link so this guide is not necessary and should only be viewed as a sample of writing capability.</p>
        <p>*** OOCN ***</p>
        <p>Thank you for purchasing the most advanced Command, Control, and Communications (C3) force multiplier on the market! We believe that complete immersive virtual experiences allow command staff to maintain a higher level of situational awareness than is traditionally achievable with legacy technology.</p>
