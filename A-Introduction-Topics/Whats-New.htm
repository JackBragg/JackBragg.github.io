        <h1>What's New</h1>
        <p>As technology progresses, so too does PLEXSYS. Keeping XYZ at the forefront is a full time endeavor and as such, improvements will be rolled out as they are built.</p>
        <p>XYZ is now part of the steam market and can be located on any system. Simply install and login using your product code. Any other system using the same product code will have the program automatically uninstalled unless using an enterprise license key.</p>
        <p>XYZ is now compatible with all consumer VR headsets.</p>
        <p>XYZ&#160;can now utilize Oculus Quest room scale to reduce the requirements of location tracking hardware while simultaneously facilitating increased versatility.</p>
